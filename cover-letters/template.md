Dear {{hiring_manager}},

I’m excited to apply for the **{{role}}** role at **{{company}}**. I bring a blend of hands-on engineering depth in private 5G/Wi-Fi and a track record of growing revenue from zero to multi-million by aligning technical execution with customer outcomes.

- Led presales and delivery across carriers, cloud providers, and enterprises; turned complex requirements into deployable, supported solutions.
- Built partnerships across vendors, suppliers, and service providers; accelerated GTM and solution integration.
- Drove scalable, HA architectures (5GC, Wi-Fi, SD-WAN/SASE) and automation to shorten time-to-value.

I’d welcome the chance to discuss how I can contribute to {{company}}’s goals in {{role}}. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
